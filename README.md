# SnoringWarning
A customisable client-side mod for Content Warning that adds silly snoring sound and disables player's visor when player is asleep.

# Settings
- Snore sound
 - Represents a type of snore sound when player falls asleep. Can be either Silent (sounds like hooo mimimi) or Loud (sounds like AUGHHH)
 - Default value: Silent
- Snore volume
 - Self-explanatory. Can be within range of 0 and 100. **Setting this at value more than 50-75% is heavily advised, because at that point snore will be ear-shatteting!**
 - Default value: 25%
